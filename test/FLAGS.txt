The following are the flags that can be used in the Python testfile:

-nodfdesc 
Suppresses the dataFrame.describe() function for your Dataframe

-nodesc
Suppresses the examples.describe() function for Training Features, Training Targets, Validation Features, and Validation Targets

-nocorr
Suppresses the dataFrame.corr() function to prevent displaying the Correlation matrix for the Dataframe

-noplot
Suppresses the pyplot to prevent displaying the graph of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) versus Periods for the Training model

The flags can be accessed by typing into the command line an input similar to:

python filename.py <flag1> <flag2> <flag3> <flag4>

For instance:

py testefile_twofeatures.py -nocorr -nodfdesc

All four flags can be used together as well, and their position in the command line does not alter the program.
